## IntelliCharge :- Smart Wireless Charging System for EVs ðŸš—âš¡
A proof-of-concept project demonstrating a smart wireless EV charging system with an integrated Nextion HMI display and a companion Android application for a seamless, contactless experience.

## Core Concept:
IntelliCharge is designed to simplify the electric vehicle charging process. By leveraging wireless charging technology and a mobile-first interface, it eliminates the need for physical cables and connectors. The system's status can be monitored in real-time through a physical HMI display on the charging unit and a user-friendly Android app.

## HMI Display (Android App):
The core of the user interaction is the HMI Display Android application. This app serves as the central control panel, allowing users to manage their charging sessions remotely.

## Payment Integration: This app includes a basic, proof-of-concept payment gateway. The workflow is designed to simulate a real-world EV charging transaction:
1)Authorize Payment: Before a charging session begins, the user adds a payment method.
2)Session Billing: Costs are calculated based on the duration of the charge.
3)Secure Checkout: The transaction is completed securely within the app upon session completion.
   This feature demonstrates the integration of a monetization model into the user experience.

## Key Features:
1)Remote Control: Start and stop charging sessions directly from your phone.
2)Real-Time Monitoring: View live data, including charging status, battery level, and connection strength.
3)Contactless Experience: A completely digital interface for a modern and hygienic interaction. 
4)Intuitive UI: A clean and simple design focused on ease of use. 

## How to Get the AppYou can download and test the Android application by following these steps:
